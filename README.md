### üåü Data Scraping: Scraped Meteorological Data for Peruvian Central Bank 

Banco de la Reserva del Peru (The Peruvian Central Bank) needed to gain access to Meteorological Data from SENHAMI (Servicio Nacional de Meteorolog√≠a e Hidrolog√≠a del Per√∫). During this project I set up scrapers using Selenium to scrape this data from the site's micro-application into a single data repository which was then shared with the team at the Central Bank. To conclude this project I presented my findings and gave a brief explanation of the methods used.

### üåü Data Analysis: Survey Data Analysis for Novel Insights 

Davis & Gilbert (Corporate Law Firm) engaged with Marcelo to work on survey data analysis to provide novel insights for their yearly report to their client portfolio. As part of this project I work mainly with CSV files provided by Davis & Gilbert and subsequently perform the analysis using Python. As part of this project I liaise directly with the Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Partners at the Law Firm.

### üåü Data Integration: International Startup Data Lake Consolidation

Wuufy.io (Startup in Vet-Tech Space) needed to integrate multiple datasets into a single repository/database for employees across the organization to be able to query and utilize data to gain insights into their customer based, potential opportunities, etc. As part of this project I set up a series of API connections to the platforms Wuufy.io was using and subsequently created a serverless database using AWS and postgreSQL for Wuufy.io to access all of their data using SQL.
